Project: Admin Dashboard from The Odin Project

Flex would be a better fit for a lot of the layout in this project.

The side menu and trending are one dimensional.

Announcements can be sized from the content. Think that makes more sence.

The header can be divided with grid, but then the two part can be layed
out with flex.
